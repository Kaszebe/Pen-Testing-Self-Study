# Pen-Testing-Self-Study

I'm a professional copywriter with 15+ years of experience. My "day job" consists of me writing persuasive content for manufacturing companies that sell their products (e.g. blog posts that rank well in Google for long-tail keywords, case studies, and internal product pages).      

That saidâ€”I have decided to take it upon myself to "self study" and learn pen testing at night. The goal is to spend 1-2 hours every weeknight (weekends too?) going through the lessons at TryHackMe and other free online resources.      

I'm currently treating this repo as a place to verbally vomit what's on my mind. Do not expect to find pitch-perfect grammar/etc. I'm not getting paid to write this.      

I have been led to believe that my background as a freelance copywriter and knowledge of SEO (moreso my server/website/web app experience) will be a benefit as a pen tester. I also have AI experience. Two years ago I built a ~$25k server that consisted of seven 4090s, ROMED8-2T motherboard, 512Gb DDR4 RAM, and an EPYC CPU. I also fine-tuned a few AI models for copywriting purposes. I assume that could be a potential advantage as well.      

I'm using this blog as part motivation and part documentation to prove to any future employers/colleagues/etc that I know my shit. Of which I currently don't know my ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to pen testing.      

I am currently considering IoT pen testing for manufacturing companies (I was a Sr. Buyer for many years at a mfg company). However, that could (and will?) change as the months and years go by. Or not.  

I'm giving myself 3 years on the short end and 5 years on the long end to learn enough such that I can take the various certification tests (OSCP, CEH, GPEN, CIoTSP, ETSI EN 303 645, IEC 62443, and UL 2900, etc). I highly doubt 3 years is enough time of self study and even 5 years is probably too short to get all those certs.      

However, I am treating this journey as a marathon vs. a sprint wherein I study every night and progress at my own pace.

Commands:

pwd - directory you're currently in

 (current directory). This is the directory you are currently in.
.. (parent directory). Takes you to the directory above your current. (e.g. cd ..)
~ (home directory). This directory defaults to your “home directory”. Such as /home/pete. (e.g. cd ~)
- (previous directory). This will take you to the previous directory you were just at (e.g. cd --)

-a flag shows hidden files
-l flag shows detailed list of files in a long format
oYu can add them both together with -la. The order of the flags determines which order it goes in, most of the time this doesn’t really matter so you can also do ls -al and it would still work.
